    question: "Do we have the budget for this training?",
    answer: "We understand that training budgets are limited. That's why FluentPro is designed to be cost-effective, delivering measurable results like fewer communication errors, better client interactions, and improved efficiency. Plus, you only need to purchase a set number of seats—inactive users are automatically removed, freeing up space for more motivated staff at no extra cost. We explain this in more detail during your free demo call."

    question: "Will this disrupt staff's busy schedules?",
    answer: "FluentPro is designed for busy professionals, allowing staff to learn at their own pace without interrupting work. Unlike traditional training, it is accessible on-demand, so employees can practice anytime, even in short sessions. Just a few minutes a day can lead to long-term improvements in communication and productivity."
  },
  {
    question: "How is this different from our current training?",
    answer: "Most traditional training methods help with general English skills like day to day vocabulary and grammar, which can be useful for language development. FluentPro, however, goes a step further by focusing on industry and role-specific scenarios, interactive role-plays, and AI-powered feedback. This way, employees don't just learn English—they learn the English they need to perform their job better."
